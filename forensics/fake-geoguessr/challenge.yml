  We don't do guess challs here at TJCTF, so that means no Geoguessr üòû Since I took this photo myself, though, you can find out precisely where it was taken, and some Bonus Content‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, from my Camera Model Name to the Circle Of Confusion. Maybe you'll find a flag there?

flag:
  file: ./flag.txt

provide:
  - ./lake.jpg
