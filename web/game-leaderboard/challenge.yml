  I (superandypancake) signed up for this tournament to win a flag! Unfortunately, I'm not so good. But I'm sure there still is a way to get the flag... right?!?

  {{link}}

flag:
  file: server/flag.txt
containers:
  main:
    build: server
    ports:
      - 3000

expose:
  main:
    - target: 3000
      http: game-leaderboard

provide:
  - ./server/index.js
