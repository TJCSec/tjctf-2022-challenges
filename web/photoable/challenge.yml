  My games always play at like 3 fps, so I thought it'd be more efficient to send individual frames rather than videos.
  Anyways, I'm sure my website is unhackable, and that you are never gonna find the flag on my server!

  {{link}}
flag:
  file: server/flag.txt

containers:
  main:
    build: server
    replicas: 1
    ports:
      - 8080
expose:
  main:
    - target: 8080
      http: photoable
provide:
  - kind: zip
    spec:
      as: server.zip
      exclude:
        - server/flag.txt
      files:
        - server
      additional:
        - path: server/flag.txt
          str: this is not the real flag
