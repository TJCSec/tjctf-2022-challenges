  I've been studying ciphers lately and came up with this new one! I'm so confident in its security that I'll give you a flag encrypted with it. I also tested it by encrypting this meme I made, what do you think?

flag:
  file: ./flag.txt

provide:
  - ./cipher.py
  - ./lol.bmp
  - ./lol.bmp.enc
  - ./flag.txt.enc
